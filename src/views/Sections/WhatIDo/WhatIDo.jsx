                        After 5+ years of working with undergraduate students,
                        I&apos;ve found that conversations about physics homework always
                        lead to general questions about how to succeed in the sciences {emoji("üí™")}.
                        The reason is really simple: you want to know whether what you&apos;re
                        learning now will be something you use later in your career!
